Behavioral Questions
====================

Since the majority of networking being done at this point of the year is related to job-searching, we thought we'd give you a hand.  Below is a comprehensive list of behavioral questions we've seen over the years.   Any MBA should be ready to answer each of these questions on a whim, and be able to draw from more than one example for each.  If you're looking for fellow consultants to do practice interviews with, don't forget to enter "consulting" as an interest in Meeteor - we'll go ahead and schedule times for you to meet up and do practice cases!
 Goodluck all!

 candidates?

* Are you applying for any other internships? (Say that you are or that you will be. Don't look like you're only applying to X Firm.  If they
 ask whether or not you think you'll get those other internships, say yes.  However, make sure they understand that X Firm is your first choice.)
